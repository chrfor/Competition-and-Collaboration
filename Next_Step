What are the next steps to optimize the DDPG algorithm 
- To insert API Call to visualize the architecture when training to help debugging the ongoing job
- To add different random noise per agent in order to explore the action spaces in a more efficient way (More different directions)
- To try out other algorithms 
    -PPO
    -D4PG
    -MADDPG
